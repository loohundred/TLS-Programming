Example of HTTPS communication with OpenSSL in C++//*106
https_server.c contains code for the server responds to the client's request through https.//*146
https is the process of adding an encryption between http and tcp, and the code implementation differs from the general TCP Server in two ways:
After accpet(), the ssl takes over the socket, completing operations such as negotiating the encryption algorithm and exchanging keys.//*43
Then we replace send() and recv() with SSL's SSL_write() and SSL_read() functions.
The OpenSSL Project develops and maintains the OpenSSL software - a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication.
https_client.c contains code for the client to request a page from the server through https which is implemented via openssl.//*60
